`dmarc2html.py` is a command line conversion script. It takes the path to the aggregate report file as parameter and output HTML code.

`filter.py` is an OpenSMTPd filter process. For any email to the given account address, it will process the attachment and replace the emailâ€™s main part by the resulting HTML code.
